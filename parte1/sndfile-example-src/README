To build:
	make

To test:
	../sndfile-example-bin/wav_cp sample.wav copy.wav // copies "sample.wav" into "copy.wav"

	../sndfile-example-bin/wav_hist sample.wav 0 normal // outputs the histogram of channel 0 (left)
	../sndfile-example-bin/wav_hist sample.wav 0 mid // outputs the histogram of mid channel (mono)
	../sndfile-example-bin/wav_hist sample.wav 0 side // outputs the histogram of side channel (side)

	../sndfile-example-bin/wav_dct sample.wav out.wav // generates a DCT "compressed" version

	../sndfile-example-bin/wav_quant sample.wav shifting 15 // generates a "reduced.wav" file using the shifting method 
															// where samples are represented by 15 bits
	../sndfile-example-bin/wav_quant sample.wav rounding 4  // generates a "reduced.wav" file using the rounding method 
															// where samples are represented by 4 bits

	../sndfile-example-bin/wav_cmp sample.wav reduced.wav   // Computes SNR between the audio signals from sample.wav and reduced.wav 
															// includes maximum per sample error

	../sndfile-example-bin/wav_effects sample.wav		    // generates "SingleEcho.wav" and "MultipleEcho.wav" files
															// each one including its corresponding echo effect based on sample.wav
